## Redox Keyboard 
One source of my pain: https://github.com/aliasboink/rev2.0WHS_pictures

## Other stuff...
Here I've realized that a lot of stuff one does cannot be turned into a narrative that easily, but maybe the following can...
- Rooting two robot vaccuums (Roborock S5 Max and Dreame D10s Pro)
- Plain Text Accounting with Beancount with small caveats for my use case; this one would be the most interesting, beacuse most articles talk about the philosophy moreso than showing how to do it
- Configuration management with stow and Ansible (although I feel there's a lot of this out there already)
